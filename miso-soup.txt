Ingredients
4 cups water
1/2 cup chopped green chard or other sturdy green
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup firm tofu, cubed
3-4 Tbsp white miso paste (fermented soy bean paste) with or without 
bonito (fish flavor, though bonito makes it non vegan- vegetarian-friendly.)
optional: 1 sheet (1/4 cup) nori (dried seaweed), cut into large rectangles

Instructions
>Place water in a medium sauce pan and bring to a low simmer.
>Add nori and simmer for 5-7 minutes.
>In the meantime, place 3 Tbsp of miso into a small bowl, add a little hot water and 
>whisk until smooth. This will ensure it doesnâ€™t clump. Set aside.
>Add green chard, green onion, and tofu to the pot and cook for 5 minutes. Then remove 
>from heat, add miso mixture, and stir to combine. 
>Taste and add more miso or a pinch of sea salt if desired. Serve warm. Best when fresh.
